Used for Intro Web Programming course @ NHTI

(From LinkedIn)

I am a hard-working, able bodied, intelligent, and unique person, just like everybody else. I enjoy working with computers and get along pretty well with most people. I have training in multiple programming languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, Java, C#, and SQL. I am A+ Certified by CompTia and have my Database Fundamentals certification.

Currently, I am looking for a Software Development internship in New Hampshire, either concentrating on object-orientated programming or web development.

Hypoallergenic and up-to-date on shots. Great with kids!
